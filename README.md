# What is it ❓

This is a project for the Geekshub course.

The idea is to have a web page where several channels for sending messages can be created. Each one of those channels will have several messages, each 
one of them with its own attributes, such as Author, Content, Date, etc...

This is a project to evaluate the assimilation of different concepts explained during the course. Since during the course we studied HTML, CSS and
Javascript, most of the concepts to be evaluated are gonna be related to them. For example, the use of arrays, obects with attributes, methods, classes, 
variables of different types, design of the web itself, etc.

# Using it 🏃‍♀️


The way of using  the webpage is pretty straight forward.

When the page is first charged, you will be able to see an aside menu and a main body.

in the aside menu, that is always visible, you will be able to create new channels, in order to do that you just have to:
1. Click on the plus sign in the aside menu

2. Insert the name of the channel in the text box that just popped up

3. Click on the save button (if you ckick on this button without a text written in the box mentiones below, an error message will appear)

4. You will now see your new channel in the Channel list in the aside menu

In the Main body of the web page, you will see (once you click on a channel from the aside menu) 3 different subparts:

1. At the very top of the web body. A searchbar to look for messages inside the channel.

2. In the middle of the page body. A list of all the messages of the channel being displayed, with some of the details of such messages also displayed.

3. At the very bottom of the web body. A text box that will be used to store new messages in the channel at use.

When using the searchbar, it will automatically display the messages that contain the string you are writting in the textbox
once you are searching you will see a button in order to come back to the channel you were at the first place (you can as well go to any channel by 
clicking on it on the aside menu)

When using the textbox to enter new messages you just have to write the message you wanna introduce and click on the "+" symbol. That will introduce the 
message in the middle part of the web main body. Please note that the message will be displayed with user that wrote it and date and time when it was 
written. (if you click on the "+" button without anything written in the text box, an error message will appear)

# Used Technology 💻

The technology that was used in this project is a very common one, in order to develop the code, visual studio code was the software chosen, and HTML5, 
CSS and Javascript Vanilla were the languages used to write the code itself.

This web should be able to be open at any of the most standard web browsers without too many differences between them. It should be ok with the following 
web browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozzilla Firefox and Safari.

# Backend 🔙

For this specific project we have not used any backend at all. For example we dont have a database, or any similar data source.

It implies that no data is stored anywhere, and that we cannot have any kind of login in order to access the webpage.

This last point is causing our messages (once they have been introduced) to be all open by the same "fake" user, and also, that all the messages, 
channels, etc...are not saved anywhere, so they dissapear when reloading the webpage
