# What is it ❓

This is a project for the Geekshub course.

The idea is to have a web page where several channels for sending messages can be created. Each one of those channels will have several messages, each one of them with its own attributes, such as Author, Content, Date, etc...

This is a project to evaluate the assimilation of different concepts explained during the course. Since during the course we studied HTML, CSS and Javascript, most of the concepts to be evaluated are gonna be related to them. For example, the use of arrays, obects with attributes, methods, classes, variables of different types, design of the web itself, etc.

# How to run it 🏃‍♀️

The way of using the webpage is pretty straight forward.

When the page is first charged, you will be able to see an aside menu and a main body.

in the aside menu, that is always visible, you will be able to create new channels, with a textbox and a button, and at the same time you will see a list of the existing channels

In the Main body of the web page, you will see (once you click on a channel from the aside menu) 3 different subparts:

1. At the very top. A searchbar to look for messages inside the channel.

2. In the "middle". A list of all the messages of the channel being displayed, with some of the details of such messages also displayed.

3. At the very bottom. A text box that will be used to store new messages in the channel at use.

The searchbar will automatically display the messages that contain the string you are writting in the box, and a button in order to come back to the channel you were at the first place (you can as well go to any channel by clicking on it on the aside menu)

in the text box to enter new messages you just have to write the message you wanna introduce and click on the "+" symbol. That will introduce the message in the middle part of the web main body. Please note that the message will have as well the user that created the message

# UsedTech 💻

The technology that was used in this project is a very common one, in order to develop the code, visual studio code was the software chosen, and HTML5, CSS and Javascript Vanilla were the languages used to write the code itself.

This web should be able to be open at any of the more standard web browsers without too many differences between them. It should be op with the following web browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozzilla Firefox and Safari.

# Backend 🔙

For this specific project we have not used any backend at all. For example we dont have a database, or any similar data source.

It implies that no data is stored anywhere, and that we cannot have any kind of login in order to access the webpage.

This last point is causing our messages (once they have been introduced) to be all open by the same "fake" user, and also, that all the messages, channels, etc...are not saved anywhere, so they dissapear when reloading the webpage
