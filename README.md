#What is it

This is a project for the Geekshub course.

The idea is to have a web page where several channels for sending messages can be created. Each one of those channels will have several messages, each one of them with its own attributes, such as Author, Content, Date, etc...

This is a project to evaluate the assimilation of different concepts explained during the course. Since during the course we studied HTML, CSS and Javascript, most of the concepts to be evaluated are gonna be related to them. For example, the use of arrays, obects with attributes, methods, classes, variables of different types, design of the web itself, etc.

#How to run

The way of "using" the webpage is pretty staright forward.

When the page is first charged, you will be able to see an aside menu and a main body.

in the aside menu, that is always visible, you will be able to create new channels, with a textbox and a button, and at the same time you will see a list of the existing channels

In the Main body of the web page, you will see (once you click on a channel from the aside menu) 3 different subparts:

1, at the very top. A searchbar to look for messages inside the channel

2, in the "middle". A list of all the messages of the channel being displayed, with some of the details of such message also displayed.

3, at the very bottom. A text box that will be used to store new messages in the channel

The searchbar will automatically display the messages that contain the string you are writting in the box, and a button in order to come back to the channel you were at the first place (you can as well go to any channel by clicking on it on the aside menu)

in the text box to enter new messages you just have to write the message you wanna introduce and click on the "+" symbol. That will introduce the message in the middle part of the web main body. Please note that the message will have as well the user that created the message
